\section{What are Spheres}
In this section we want to inspect representations of homotopical Spheres. To give a little overview we will define the sphere to come with an orientation. To be more specific we have the definition:
\begin{definition}[The $k-$-Sphere]
	Let $\R^k$ be the k-dimensional vector space given as the span of $e_1,\dots e_k$ together with the eucliden metric $\norm{\cdot}_2$. Then the set
	\begin{align*}
		S^k\coloneq \{x\in \R^k|\norm{x}_2=1 \}
	\end{align*} is called the \textbf{$k-$sphere}.
\end{definition} This sphere will be our save haven where we will always come back to. In this definition there is no room for "diffrent orientations on a sphere". In our reality we will detect the two  "different orientations" of a space $A$ homotopic to a sphere that arise from two constructions as follows: assume that $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the maps $A\to S^k$. then there is an endomorphism $f: S^k\to S^k$ such that our diagramm commutes:

\begin{tikzcd}
	& A \arrow[rd, "\beta"] \arrow[ld, "\alpha"'] &     \\
	S^k \arrow[rr, "f"] &                                             & S^k
\end{tikzcd}
\end{center}
 Now $f^*:K^n(S^k)\to K^n(S^k)$ is an isomorphism and hence either the identity or minus the identity.
 
 
Now we have a lot of spaces that are homotopic or even homeomorph to the sphere. Just to name a view constructions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A disc in $\R^k$ modulo its boundary $D^k\slash \partial D^k$.
	\item The cone over $D^{k-1}$.
	\item The resduced and unreduced susopension of a $k-1$ sphere. 
	\item The one-point compactification of a vector space together with an oriented basis.
\end{enumerate}
We already saw how we can map the one-point compactification of a vector space with an ordered basis to a sphere wia the stereographic projections from the south pole. 
So lets inspect the other constructions
