 abstract = {The role played by the fundamental group in §13 indicates that their higher dimensional analogs—the homotopy groups of Hurewicz—should be of considerable importance in the study of bundles. This section is a brief résumé of homotopy groups. Basic definitions and principal properties will be stated in detail. Proofs will only be indicated. For a fuller exposition see [55].The definition of thenth homotopy group of a space,πn(X,x0), is strictly analogous to that of the fundamental group. We replace the intervalI= [0,1] by then-cube Inconsisting of pointst= (t1, …,tn},

  abstract  = {In [J. Topol. Anal. 6 (2014), 305–338], we have developed a homology theory (Morse–Conley–Floer homology) for isolated invariant sets of arbitrary flows on finite-dimensional manifolds. In this paper, we investigate functoriality and duality of this homology theory. As a preliminary, we investigate functoriality in Morse homology. Functoriality for Morse homology of closed manifolds is known, but the proofs use isomorphisms to other homology theories. We give direct proofs by analyzing appropriate moduli spaces. The notions of isolated map and flow map allow the results to generalize to local Morse homology and Morse–Conley–Floer homology. We prove Poincaré-type duality statements for local Morse homology and Morse–Conley–Floer homology.},
